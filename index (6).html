        <h1 class="mb-3">Natalie Ebeid
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science-International Affairs</div>
       <p class="lead mb-4">Natalie Ebeid is a student who will graduate in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of California, Riverside. She was born in Cairo, Egypt, then moved to the United States at the age of seven. Raised in socio-culturally-stimulating surroundings, with lively discussions extending to cultures, histories, and world affairs, this early exposure nurtured her passion for international relations and her desire to go far beyond that.

<br><br>
       
Having had a growing interest in diplomacy and governance, she's largely focused on Egypt and the Middle East. She seeks to use her educational know-how and experience to actively participate in the discussions surrounding international policy, development, and human rights issues occurring in that region.
<br><br>

Outside academics, Natalie is engaged in applying political science concepts in the real world. With Model United Nations, she learned the practice of diplomacy, negotiation, and global problem-solving. Through MUN, she has developed critical thinking skills, engaged with her counterparts in respectful debate, and worked toward collaborative solutions. She holds all these abilities at her disposal, for they are very useful in the field of international affairs.
<br><br>

Natalie worked as a substitute proctor, a company from which she learned to be flexible and to adapt to new situations. Never more than when managing students in that perfectly stifling and boring atmosphere of exam time or navigating a complex international issue in MUN does she thrive, really into such active elements that provide her challenges.
<br><br>

Apart from being fluent in English and Arabic, Natalie values the extent to which it is possible to communicate across cultures. To her, a language is more than just a tool; it is a bridge that fosters understanding and connection. This special bilingual ability gives her a different viewpoint on international issues that allows her to engage all sorts of voices and narratives. 
<br><br>

Natalie is a traveler in spirit; thus, when she is not studying or working, she would most likely be pursuing her interests in seeing different cultures and the world from other angles. Along the way, the trips strengthened her conviction that cross-cultural dialogue and mutual understanding must be the backbone of global affairs.
<br><br>

In the future, her sights are set on international diplomacy, global policy, or something in that realm that will allow her in some way or another to influence world affairs for humanity's betterment. Not only does she want to work for organizations involved with Middle Eastern affairs, but she is also interested in development and international cooperation.
<br><br>

The whole experience of growing up in Egypt, continuing undergrad and grad school in the US, and now working under professional circumstances makes her one hell of a different perspective on global issues. She wholly believes that change for the better can happen through diplomacy, education, and cultural exchange, and she wants to be part of that change.
